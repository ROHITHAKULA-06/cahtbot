     The application.java class has 2 methods one is for finding the path of the application and the other is to open the application.
     then the url.java searchs the context you give it.

     Note : for opening an application yoou have to type "open" before mentioning the name of the application.
            And if you want to search something in browser then type search before mentioning the context you want to search.
